# 0x10. Python - Network #0

## Project Overview

This project consists of a series of scripts designed to explore and demonstrate fundamental network operations using Python. The scripts cover various methods of making HTTP requests and handling HTTP responses, manipulating headers, and understanding web server interactions.

## Files Description

Here is a brief overview of each script in the repository:

- **0-body_size.sh** - Bash script that sends a request to a URL and displays the size of the body of the response.
- **1-body.sh** - Bash script that sends a GET request to a URL and displays the body of the response.
- **100-status_code.sh** - Bash script that sends a request to a URL and displays the status code of the response.
- **101-post_json.sh** - Bash script that sends a JSON POST request to a URL and displays the body of the response.
- **102-catch_me.sh** - Bash script that makes a request to a certain server that causes it to respond with a specific message in certain conditions.
- **2-delete.sh** - Bash script that sends a DELETE request to a URL and displays the body of the response.
- **3-methods.sh** - Bash script that displays all HTTP methods the server of a given URL will accept.
- **4-header.sh** - Bash script that sends a GET request with a header variable to a URL and displays the body of the response.
- **5-post_params.sh** - Bash script that sends a POST request with parameters to a URL and displays the body of the response.
- **6-peak.py** and **6-peak.txt** - Python script and its corresponding text file that involve finding a peak in a list of unsorted integers.

## Usage

Each script can be executed on a Unix bash shell. For example, to run the `0-body_size.sh` script, you would use the following command:

```bash
./0-body_size.sh <URL>
